# Package-specific overrides for false positives
packageRules:
  # oxlint is a Rust-based JavaScript/TypeScript linter from the Oxc project.
  # The npm package contains compiled native binaries (Rust -> machine code),
  # which static analysis tools incorrectly flag as "obfuscated code".
  # This is a false positive - the code is compiled, not obfuscated.
  # Source: https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc (MIT licensed)
  - name: oxlint
    action: ignore
    reason: >-
      False positive: oxlint contains compiled Rust binaries distributed via npm.
      Compiled machine code appears obfuscated to static analysis but is legitimate.

  # oxfmt is a Rust-based JavaScript/TypeScript formatter from the Oxc project.
  # Same rationale as oxlint - contains compiled native binaries.

    reason: >-
      False positive: oxfmt contains compiled Rust binaries distributed via npm.
