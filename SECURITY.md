## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Lintro, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent potential exploitation.

### 2. **Email us directly**

Send an email to: **security@turbocoder13.com**

### 3. **Include the following information:**

- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)
- **Your contact information** (optional, for follow-up questions)

### 4. **What happens next:**

- We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- We will investigate and provide updates
- We will work on a fix and coordinate disclosure
- We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users:

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 0.1.1, 0.1.2) and will be clearly marked in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

- We will not publicly disclose vulnerabilities until a fix is available
- We will work with reporters to coordinate disclosure timing
- We will credit security researchers in our advisories
- We will maintain transparency about our security practices
