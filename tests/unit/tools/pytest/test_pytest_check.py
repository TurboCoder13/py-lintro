"""Unit tests for pytest tool check method functionality.

This file contains tests that don't fit into the specialized categories
(basic, docker, collection) and serve as integration points between
different test categories.
"""

# This file intentionally left mostly empty as all tests have been moved
# to more specific test files:
# - test_pytest_check_basic.py: Basic check functionality tests
# - test_pytest_check_docker.py: Docker-related check tests
# - test_pytest_check_collection.py: Test collection tests

# Future tests that span multiple categories can be added here
