## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in lintro, please report it by:

1. **Do NOT open a public GitHub issue**
2. Email the maintainers directly or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
3. Include detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for the issue to be addressed before public disclosure

## Repository Secrets

This project uses several GitHub repository secrets for CI/CD automation. Below is
documentation of their purposes and security considerations.

### Required Secrets

| Secret Name          | Purpose                              | Scope              | Rotation     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------ |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN`       | Built-in token for GitHub API access | Automatic          | Per-workflow |
| `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN` | Push to homebrew-tap repository      | `repo` on tap repo | Annually     |
| `CODECOV_TOKEN`      | Upload coverage reports              | Codecov org        | As needed    |

### Optional Secrets

| Secret Name      | Purpose                                   | When Needed                  |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `RELEASE_TOKEN`  | Create releases with elevated permissions | If GITHUB_TOKEN insufficient |
| `PYPI_API_TOKEN` | Manual PyPI publishing (backup)           | If OIDC fails                |

### Token Security Guidelines

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Each token should have only the minimum permissions
   required for its task.

2. **OIDC Preferred**: For PyPI publishing, we use OIDC (OpenID Connect) trusted
   publishing instead of API tokens. This eliminates long-lived credentials.

3. **Token Rotation Schedule**:
   - `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN`: Rotate annually or immediately if compromised
   - `CODECOV_TOKEN`: Rotate if Codecov reports suspicious activity
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatic, no rotation needed

4. **Secret Scanning**: GitHub secret scanning is enabled to detect accidentally
   committed credentials.

## Workflow Security

### Harden Runner

All workflows use `step-security/harden-runner` with strict egress policies:

```yaml
- name: Harden Runner
  uses: step-security/harden-runner@<sha>
  with:
    egress-policy: 'block'
    allowed-endpoints: >
      github.com:443 api.github.com:443 pypi.org:443 pypi.python.org:443
      upload.pypi.org:443 files.pythonhosted.org:443
```

### Action Pinning

All third-party actions are pinned to full commit SHAs, not version tags:

```yaml
# Good - pinned to SHA
uses: actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683

# Bad - version tag can be moved
uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

The `validate-action-pinning.yml` workflow enforces this policy.

### Permissions

Workflows follow the principle of least privilege:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read  # Default: read-only

# Only escalate when necessary
permissions:
  contents: write  # For releases
  id-token: write  # For OIDC
```

## Permission Scopes by Workflow

| Workflow                   | Permissions                        | Justification         |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `test-and-coverage.yml`    | `contents: read`                   | Read-only testing     |
| `publish-pypi-on-tag.yml`  | `contents: write, id-token: write` | Release + OIDC        |
| `build-binary.yml`         | `contents: write`                  | Upload release assets |
| `docker-build-publish.yml` | `contents: read, packages: write`  | Push to GHCR          |

## Supply Chain Security

### SBOM Generation

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is generated for each release using:

- `cyclonedx-bom` for Python dependencies
- Attestation artifacts for verification

### Dependency Updates

- Dependabot monitors for security updates
- Renovate handles routine dependency updates
- All updates require CI passing before merge

## Code Signing

PyPI packages are published using OIDC trusted publishing, which provides:

- Cryptographic proof of build provenance
- No long-lived credentials to leak
- Transparent build logs

## Incident Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediately** revoke any compromised tokens
2. **Audit** recent workflow runs for suspicious activity
3. **Notify** users if their data may be affected
4. **Document** the incident and response
5. **Improve** controls to prevent recurrence
